    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const way1 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const way2 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const way3 = [...players];

    const way4 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Mohana Naga Venkat',
      age: 20
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const copy = Object.assign({}, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const copy2 = { ...person };

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
